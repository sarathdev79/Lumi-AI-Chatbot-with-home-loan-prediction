# Lumi
Our model uses python and flask for data analysis/backend web framework and HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the front end. 

This code loads the dataset containing intents and associated patterns from a JSON file named 'data.json'. It pre-processes the dataset by tokenizing and stemming the words, removing punctuation marks, and creating a bag-of-words representation. A PyTorch Dataset is created to organize the training data, which includes input-output pairs. The neural network model architecture is defined, training is performed using the provided dataset, and the trained model along with related metadata is saved to a file named 'data.pth'.


▪
LUMI is built on two AI subsystems
▪
Lumi streamlines customer support by providing instant responses to frequently asked questions (FAQs) using Deep Learning Neural Net methods to train an extensive FAQ database, and intent capturing techniques.
▪
Lumi utilizes machine learning algorithms trained on a large batch of data to analyze user inputs and provide near instant feedback on loan eligibility
