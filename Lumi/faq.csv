Why?,"请阅读针对恶意软件采取最新的安全措施常见问题中文版本As part of our ongoing efforts against cybercrime and to protect your online banking experience, we introduced an essential security feature to the OCBC Digital app.The latest versions of the OCBC Digital app on Android are built to work more optimally and securely on devices whose mobile apps were all downloaded from official app stores (e.g. Google Play Store or Huawei AppGallery). Such apps are verified before they are made available for downloading. Apps from other sources (e.g. official brand websites or apps installed using Android Package Kit (APK) files) are not verified. They tend to have more security vulnerabilities and so are more susceptible to malware infection, which can allow cybercriminals to gain control of your device and, subsequently, your banking app(s) and personal details.This inherent risk in apps downloaded from sources other than official app stores has been reiterated by Singaporean authorities, who classify malware scams as particularly aggressive and a serious threat to consumers. Despite constant reminders by the authorities of the dangers of downloading these apps, the number of customers falling prey to malware scams has continued to increase.If you try to access the latest OCBC Digital app on a device which has apps downloaded from sources other than an official app store, a message – warning you that one or more apps on your device may contain malware – will pop up on the screen. We recommend that you uninstall such apps before continuing to use the OCBC Digital app securely. You do not have to delete the OCBC Digital app.Alternatively, if you prefer to keep these apps after having assessed that they are not malicious and do not pose a malware risk, you may turn off ‘Accessibility’ for these apps before continuing to use the OCBC Digital app securely. You can do so via the Settings menu on your device. For example, on Samsung mobile devices with the latest One UI user interface, you can navigate to Settings > Accessibility > Installed Apps*.Turning off 'Accessibility' will cut off scammers’ remote access to, or keylogging of, your phone and any access to your bank account(s). However, we do not recommend this option because of the residual risk – cybercriminals may still exploit ‘Accessibility’ services to compromise your devices. The preferred and safer option is to uninstall apps not downloaded from official app stores to completely remove the risk of malware from such apps.*The steps to turn off an app’s ‘Accessibility’ may differ by phone model. Please refer to question 7 or check with your device manufacturer.You may refer to our article onmalwarefor more information on protecting yourself.FAQs1. When I open the OCBC Digital app, I see a pop-up message informing me that one of more apps on my device may contain malware. As part of our efforts to safeguard our customers against malware attacks, and combat fraud and scams, we have introduced an essential security feature for the OCBC Digital app.The OCBC Digital app will now work more securely on devices whose mobile apps were all downloaded from official app stores. Malware attacks may emerge from apps that are downloaded from websites and other sources (i.e. not official app stores), potentially giving cybercriminals control of your devices.The pop-up message is meant to inform you that the OCBC Digital app will not work until you uninstall one or more apps not downloaded from an official app store (this is the preferred option), or until you turn off ‘Accessibility’ for these apps.Here is what the pop-up message looks like:2. Do I have to install the OCBC Digital app again when I see the pop-up message?You do not have to delete, download, or do anything to the OCBC Digital app. Instead, please uninstall the apps shown in the pop-up message to continue using the OCBC Digital app or turn off ‘Accessibility’ for those apps.3. Will the Bank know what other apps I have on my device through this security feature?We take privacy seriously. We do not monitor customers’ phone activity or conduct surveillance on customers’ phones. The new security feature does not collect or store any personal data; neither will it identify the owner of the device. We do not collect or store information on how our customers use apps installed on their mobile device.Instead, an additional security check is simply performed directly at the device level. This means that no information or data will be transmitted back to us. The information collected at the device level is only used to identify if certain security parameters are not met. These parameters include apps residing on a device which were not downloaded from an official app store, and which have ‘Accessibility’ turned on. Apps with ‘Accessibility’ turned on can render your device more vulnerable to exploitation by hackers, scammers and other bad faith actors using malware.We apologise for the inconvenience caused and seek your understanding that the security feature was implemented to protect our customers from malware or suspected malicious apps. Please refer to our article onmalwarefor more information on how you can protect yourself.4. I want to continue using my OCBC Digital app alongside these apps. Is it possible for you to remove this control?This security feature was implemented with the intent of protecting our customers from malware and suspected malicious apps. If you wish to continue using your OCBC Digital app alongside apps that are downloaded from websites and other sources (i.e. not official app stores), you may turn off ‘Accessibility’ for such apps.Please refer to our article onmalwarefor more information on protecting yourself.5. I want to continue using my OCBC Digital app. What can I do?To continue using your OCBC Digital app securely, we recommend that you follow these steps:Uninstall the app(s) shown in the message that pops up on your screen when you open your OCBC Digital app.Log in to the OCBC Digital app to ensure that it works.Once you confirm that the OCBC Digital app works, you can try to download the app(s) you deleted from an official app store (e.g. Google Play Store, Samsung Galaxy Store, Huawei Store).",4,6198,1,1005

What is SORA (Singapore Overnight Rate Average)?,"SORA has replaced the Singapore Interbank Offered Rate (SIBOR) and Swap Offer Rate (SOR) as the key interest rate benchmark for Singapore dollar (S$) interest rate contracts.SORA is calculated and administered by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). It is published as a daily rate and a series of 1-month, 3-month and 6-month compounded rates on theMAS website. The Compounded SORA rates are calculated as the compounded average of daily SORA readings over the relevant 1-month, 3-month or 6-month periods before each publication date, reducing the effects of rate volatility.SORA is a robust and transparent benchmark anchored on actual market transactions and underpinned by a deep and liquid overnight interbank funding market. It is determined based on the volume-weighted average rate of borrowing transactions in the unsecured overnight interbank Singapore dollar cash market in Singapore between 8am and 6.15pm.",48,925,7,139
"Can I choose to retain my property loan referencing SIBOR, and not switch out of it?","As SIBOR will be discontinued after 31 December 2024, you are strongly encouraged to contact us early to explore the available options:Option 1: Any prevailing property loan package offered by usOption 2: SORA Conversion Package (SCP) at the spot-spreadOption 3: Wait for automatic conversion to the SCP in June 2024 at the historical median spreadIf you do not switch out your SIBOR-based property loan to an alternative loan package by 30 April 2024, we will automatically convert it to the SCP at the historical median spread in June 2024, 6 months ahead of the discontinuation of SIBOR (i.e. Option 3). This is to allow time for an orderly transition out of SIBOR loans by banks and customers and to ensure that all outstanding SIBOR loans are converted before SIBOR is discontinued.",84,787,16,131
What is the SORA Conversion Package?,"Banks are offering customers with existing SIBOR loans a switch to the SORA Conversion Package at no additional fees and no additional lock-in period.The SCP seeks to directly convert your existing SIBOR-based loan to a SORA-based loan. The key components of the SCP are:Your existing SIBOR loan marginwill remain unchanged;3-month Compounded SORAis a floating interest rate benchmark published by MAS (see Q1);Anadjustment spreadwill be added to account for the difference between SIBOR and the 3-month Compounded SORA.Diagram 1: Illustration of the SORA Conversion Package (SCP)You should note that there are differences in the computation of the adjustment spread, depending on the timing of your transition.Active Transition Phase (1 September 2023 to 30 April 2024)The interest on your loan will be calculated based on:3-month Compounded SORA + Your existing SIBOR loan margin + Adjustment Spread (spot-spread)where the Adjustment Spread (spot-spread) is computed as the average difference between applicable SIBOR and 3-month Compounded SORA in the preceding three-month period1. The Adjustment Spread (spot-spread) is floored at zero.The Adjustment Spread (spot-spread) is published by ABS Benchmarks Administration Co (ABS Co) on the first working day of each month2and will apply for customers transitioning to the SCP in that particular month. For example: The spot-spread published on 1 December 2023 will be used for customers who actively transition to the SCP in December 2023. After the transition, the adjustment spread remains fixed in your loan for the remaining tenor of the loan.Automatic Conversion Phase (in June 2024)The interest on your loan will be calculated based on:3-month Compounded SORA + Your existing SIBOR loan margin + Adjustment Spread (historical median)where the Adjustment Spread (historical median) is computed as the historical median between the applicable SIBOR and 3-month Compounded SORA over the period of 30 June 2018 to 30 June 2023.1-month SIBOR to 3-monthCompounded SORA3-month SIBOR to 3-monthCompounded SORAAdjustment spread (4 decimal places)0.2426%0.3571%1For example, if your existing loan reference is 1-month SIBOR, the Adjustment Spread (spot-spread) is the average difference between 1-month SIBOR and 3-month Compounded SORA in the preceding three-month period.2https://abs.org.sg/benchmark-rates/publications",36,2369,6,336
Why is there an adjustment spread in the SORA Conversion Package?,"An adjustment spread is necessary when converting a SIBOR loan to a 3-month Compounded SORA reference because of inherent differences between SIBOR and compounded SORA. The adjustment spread accounts for differences in the level of SIBOR and 3-month Compounded SORA; this maintains parity when you switch from SIBOR to 3-month Compounded SORA.SIBOR represents unsecured term (1-month or 3-month) lending rates. It includes term and credit risk premiums that account for the uncertainty in the level of interest rates over a future period as well as the risk of providing unsecured credit over a 1-month or 3-month period. In contrast, SORA and compounded SORA represent overnight lending rates and exclude such term and credit risks.Consequently, as reflected in Diagram 2 below, 3-month Compounded SORA has also typically been significantly lower than 1-month and 3-month SIBOR.Diagram 2: Historical comparison of 1-month SIBOR, 3-month SIBOR and 3-month Compounded SORA",65,971,11,146
Why is there a different approach in Adjustment Spread (retail) between the Active Transition Phase and Automatic Conversion Phase?,"The Steering Committee for SOR & SIBOR Transition (SC-STS) has recommended that the spot-spread approach (floored at zero) be applied to the SCP during the period of active transition, and the 5-year historical median, at automatic conversion. This approach has the following benefits:Provides customers with choice during the period of active transition:Customers can choose the spot-spread (potentially allowing them to lock in favourable spreads should spot-spreads be low); switch to banks’ prevailing package; or do nothing and have their packages be automatically converted in June 2024 at the 5-year historical median spread.Provides customers with certainty on automatic conversion outcome:As the 5-year historical median has been set and fixed upfront, customers would be made aware early of the adjustment spread that would apply should they do nothing and have their packages automatically converted in June 2024, in accordance with the industry timeline. On a month-to-month basis, customers would be able to compare among (i) the bank’s prevailing packages, (ii) the month’s spot-spread that would apply during the active transition period, and (iii) the 5-year historical median that would apply at automatic conversion. This would help customers make an informed decision on whether they should actively transition in that month.Given these benefits, the approach of offering customers three options for transitioning of SIBOR retail loans was also supported by respondents to the SC-STS consultation on adjustment spreads for the conversion of legacy SIBOR loans to SORA3.3See SC-STS’ Response to Consultation Feedback and Final Recommendations for Adjustment Spread for the Conversion of SIBOR Loans to SORA (30 June 2023) athttp://abs.org.sg/docs/library/response-to-feedback-on-consultation-on-adjustment-spreads-for-the-conversion-of-legacy-sibor-loans-to-sora.pdf",131,1884,19,257
Why is the 5-year historical median spread between SIBOR and Compounded SORA used as the applicable adjustment spread for the automatic conversion of SIBOR loans?,"The 5-year historical median spread – rather than the spot-spread – is used for the automatic conversion of SIBOR loans as it can be determined beforehand. This provides customers with early certainty on the terms of automatic conversion that will apply to their loan should they do nothing and have their packages be converted in June 2024.The 5-year historical median spread is a fair estimate of the average spread between SIBOR and Compounded SORA: A 5-year period is sufficiently long to smooth out the effects of idiosyncratic market events over past years and reasonably estimates where spreads could converge towards in the long run. The use of a 5-year historical median spread is also aligned to international convention adopted for the transition of similar interest rate contracts, as well as the transition of SIBOR and SOR wholesale contracts. It was supported by respondents to the SC-STS consultation on adjustment spreads for the conversion of legacy SIBOR loans to SORA.",162,988,25,159
Will the Adjustment Spread change throughout the tenor of my loan?,"The Adjustment Spread that is applied by us in the SCP, as would be stated in the contract agreement, will stay the same for the remaining tenor of your loan. There will not be any change, even though the Adjustment Spread (spot-spread) published by the ABS Co in subsequent months may move higher or lower due to fluctuations that are inherent in floating interest rates.You can refer to the ABS Co’s website for the prevailing Adjustment Spread (spot-spread) that will be applied in the SORA Conversion Package at the point where you switch your loan.",66,553,11,95
How will my interest payments change throughout the tenor of my loan?,"If you have switched to the SCP at the Adjustment Spread (spot-spread) of 0.3012%:The adjustment spread of 0.3012% will remain unchanged throughout the tenor of your loan.If your loan has a step-up tier rate, the loan after switching to the SCP will similarly have a step-up tier rate.Current SIBOR packageSORA Conversion PackageYear 2023: 3-month SIBOR + 1.00%Year 2023: 3-month Compounded SORA + 1.00% + 0.3012%Year 2024: 3-month SIBOR + 1.20%Year 2024: 3-month Compounded SORA + 1.20% + 0.3012%Year 2025 onwards: 3-month SIBOR + 1.50%Year 2025 onwards: 3-month Compounded SORA + 1.50% + 0.3012%",69,597,12,93
My loan is currently on fixed rate and will only change to a SIBOR reference rate after the fixed tenor ends. How will the transition affect my loan?,"Your loan will remain on fixed rate until the fixed tenor ends. You can decide if you wish to switch to a prevailing property loan package offered by us or switch the floating part of your loan (e.g. your loan might reference SIBOR in the fourth year, after the fixed rate period ends) to the SCP.If you decide to switch to a prevailing property loan package offered by us, no administrative or prepayment fee will be charged for the conversion. A lock-in period may apply depending on the package you choose.If you decide to switch to the SCP and you apply during the active transition period to have your package switched to the SCP, the SCP with an Adjustment Spread (spot-spread) will apply after the end of the fixed tenor.Otherwise, if you wait to have your package automatically switched to the SCP, the SCP with an Adjustment Spread (historical median) will apply after the end of the fixed tenor.",149,905,28,159

Why is my prevailing interest rate increased?,"Your prevailing interest rate has been increased because you did not make the minimum payment by the statement due date. This occurs when no payment is made, less than the minimum payment is made, or when payment is made after the statement due date.For example, an EasiCredit Account Holder is currently on a prevailing interest rate of 22.90% per annum. On December 2021’s statement, the EasiCredit Account Holder has an outstanding balance of S$588 that is due on 14 January 2022. In this example, EasiCredit Account Holder must make a payment of S$50 by 14 January 2022. The minimum payment is 3% of outstanding balance or S$50, whichever is higher, plus any overdue amount.However, as the EasiCredit Account Holder did not make the minimum payment by the statement due date, higher interest will be charged to the EasiCredit account in the next statement cycle and will apply to all outstanding balances.I am an existing EasiCredit Account Holder incurring a higher interest rate.
